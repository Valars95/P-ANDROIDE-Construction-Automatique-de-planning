# CHIC's Nurse Rostering Problem

The Nurse Rostering Problem (NRP) is a combinatorial problem whose challenge is to find an optimal allocation of agents in a hospital service over a given period (horizon). We present here the first steps of a [Sorbonne University's academic project](androide.lip6.fr/) to create planning for the maternity ward of the [Centre Hospitalier Intercommunal de Créteil (CHIC)](www.chicreteil.fr/), involving 70 midwives

- Our first objective is to generate partial solutions of sufficient quality to allow planning mangers to save time.

- We stand on real and anonymized data sets.
- We combine [linear programming](https://www.scipopt.org/) and heuristics approaches
